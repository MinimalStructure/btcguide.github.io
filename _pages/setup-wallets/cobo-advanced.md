#### Verify Your Firmware Before Installing
Confirm that the sha256 hash digest of the file you downloaded matches what is expected:

```
$ shasum -a 256 V1.4.0-BTC_Only.zip
afb82abe013373c262cbd518ebd9bbcf7156b713270b776a4c3d3a15d69bb0f0  V2.0.1-BTC_Only.zip
```
(This is accurate for `v.2.0.1` but will become stale for future releases. Calculate the hash digest of the new file and confirm that it matches what's published by the company.)

## Not Perfect
No device is perfect and this one is no exception.
